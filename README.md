## Plan on improving the project

When the user clics on the menu items, there could be a pop up window describing the drink or bake good. For exemple, the ingridients, the possible add ons and a photo of the product could be found in this new section.

A tea section could be added to the menu. That way, the users could have more information about the Triple Peaks' tea collection.

Also, on the footer, there could be a button redirecting the user to the header, so they don't have to scroll all the way back.
